## Project Overview

### Background
Design and develop a chat agent for the **PartSelect e-commerce website** with the following specifications:

- **Product Focus:** Refrigerator and Dishwasher parts only
- **Primary Function:** Provide product information and assist with customer transactions

  - Installation guidance
  - Compatibility checking
  - Troubleshooting assistance

### Backend Requirements
- **Architecture:** Any backend architecture of your choice
- **Tools:** Free to use any online tools, vector databases, and supplementary materials
- **LLM Integration:** **Must include integration with DeepSeek language model**
- **Data Management:** Implement efficient product catalog search and retrieval

## Success Criteria

Your implementation will be evaluated on:

1. **Interface Design** - User experience and visual appeal
2. **Agentic Architecture** - How well the AI agent is structured and operates
3. **Extensibility** - How easily the system can be expanded or modified
4. **Scalability** - System's ability to handle growth and increased load
5. **Query Accuracy** - Precision and efficiency in answering user questions

## Example Use Cases

Your solution should handle queries like these (but not be limited to them):
